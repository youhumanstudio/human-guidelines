    <p><strong>Congratulations!</strong> You are now the proud owner of <em>Human Guidelines: A Book That Doesn’t Exist (Because It Can’t).</em></p>

    <p>Published by ForgettablePublishing and "written" by Anybody, Everybody, and Nobody, <em>Human Guidelines</em> is the ultimate guide to… well, nothing. Because the truth is, there are no universal rules to being human.</p>

    <p>Clicking through to the “real” guide reveals the only wisdom worth knowing: your human experience is yours alone. No one-size-fits-all handbook, no step-by-step manual, just the radical truth that going inward is the only way to create an authentic path.</p>

    <p>This book (or lack of one) is a playful jab at the endless self-help and corporate leadership books promising the right way to be human, when in reality, your humanity is not something to be fixed. It is something to be felt.</p>

    <p>Truthfully, if there were a book, it wouldn’t be about fixing you. It would be about feeling, healing, and learning to trust your own wisdom. Being human is not a process to perfect, it is an experience to live.</p>

    <p>Whether you are leading a team, leading yourself, or figuring it all out as you go, your journey alone is a book in itself. And while there is no universal guide, there are thousands of beautiful books created by those who forged their own path. There are systems to help, intuitives to guide you more closely, healers to hold space while you heal your hurts, and communities to make it all easier, more fun, and a richer human experience.</p>

    <p>If you are curious about what this could look like for you, <strong>start with a conversation.</strong></p>

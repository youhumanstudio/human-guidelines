    <p><strong>Congratulations!</strong> You are now the proud owner of <em>Human Guidelines – A Book That Doesn’t Exist (Because It Can’t).</em></p>

    <p>Published by ForgettablePublishing and "written" by Anybody, Everybody, and Nobody, <em>Human Guidelines</em> is the ultimate guide to… well, nothing. Because the truth is, there are no universal rules to being human.</p>

    <p>Clicking through to the “real” guide reveals the only wisdom worth knowing: your human experience is yours alone. No one-size-fits-all handbook, no step-by-step manual—just the radical truth that going inward is the only way to create an authentic path.</p>

    <p>This book (or lack thereof) is a playful jab at the endless self-help and corporate leadership books promising the "right way" to be human, when in reality, your humanity isn't something to be fixed—it’s something to be felt.</p>

    <p>So go ahead, open this book, flip through the invisible pages, and embrace the fact that you’re already the author of your own experience.</p>

    <p><strong>Your journey is unique, and only by going inward can you create your own authentic path. No book can write that for you.</strong></p>
